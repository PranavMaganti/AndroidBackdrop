        id="Overdraw"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Possible overdraw: Root element paints background `@color/colorPrimary` with a theme that also paints a background (inferred theme is `@android:style/Theme.Holo`)"
        category="Performance"
        priority="3"
        summary="Overdraw: Painting regions more than once"
        explanation="If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme background will be painted first, only to have your custom background completely cover it; this is called &quot;overdraw&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it&apos;s currently doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.&#xA;&#xA;If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.&#xA;&#xA;Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead."

        id="RtlEnabled"
        severity="Warning"
        message="The project references RTL attributes, but does not explicitly enable or disable RTL support with `android:supportsRtl` in the manifest"
        category="Internationalization:Bidirectional Text"
        priority="3"
        summary="Using RTL attributes without enabling RTL support"
        explanation="To enable right-to-left support, when running on API 17 and higher, you must set the `android:supportsRtl` attribute in the manifest `&lt;application>` element.&#xA;&#xA;If you have started adding RTL attributes, but have not yet finished the migration, you can set the attribute to false to satisfy this lint check.">
